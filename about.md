##Who am I?
I am a JC2/12th Grade student studying in [National Junior College](http://www.nationaljc.moe.edu.sg), Singapore. I received the SM1 Scholarship to study in Singapore. I was born in Chengdu, China.

I am very keen in learning about Computer Science. I started working on a project last year (and I still am) on multi-agent systems with [Mr. Somchaya Liemhetcharat](http://www.somchaya.org) on using Synergy Graph to predict performance of basketball line-ups. An extended abstract has been published on AAMAS 2015. I am mainly involved in using machine learning to build various models to benchmark Adversarial Synergy Graph approach.

You can follow me on Twitter/Facebook and etc. although I am not an active user.
But I do frequent [Zhihu](http://www.zhihu.com/people/luo-yicheng) (知乎), I just received ~1000 likes by answering a question on stationaries.

##About the site
I procrastinate, so I have a full load of drafts on my laptop. I guess I will update if I am free.

The site is hosted on Github Pages with Jekyll (Github's default) as the static blog generator. I am also inspired by [Lepture's](http://lepture.com) [yue.css](https://github.com/lepture/yue.css) for readable content in Chinese/English. You may find some interesting discussions [here](http://lepture.com/zh/2014/chinese-fonts-and-yue-css)
