I am a JC2/12th Grade student studying in [National Junior College](http://www.nationaljc.moe.edu.sg), Singapore. I received the SM1 Scholarship to study in Singapore. I was born in Chengdu, China.

I am very keen in learning about Computer Science. I started working on a project last year (and I still am) with [Mr. Somchaya Liemhetcharat](http://www.somchaya.org) on using Synergy Graph to predict performance of basketball line-ups. An extended abstract has been published on AAMAS 2015. I am mainly involved in using machine learning to build various models to benchmark Adversarial Synergy Graph approach.

You can follow me on Twitter/Facebook and etc. although I am not an active user.
